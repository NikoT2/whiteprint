    "A board game by EU created to raise awareness of Georgia’s deep-rooted connections with Europe and to support the country’s path toward European Union integration. Through interactive, double-sided cards featuring key events, reforms, and historical milestones, players engage with the long history of relations between Georgia and Europe.",
    "The project was delivered under emergency conditions, requiring a full-service development within one week. Our team developed the idea, design, structure, format and advertising materials from the scratch. Seemingly impossible project became an unforgettable feat of our joint group-work and dedicated approach, successfully finishing the project within the deadline. ",
