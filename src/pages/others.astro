            A board game by EU created to raise awareness of Georgia's
            deep-rooted connections with Europe and to support the country's
            path toward European Union integration. Through interactive,
            double-sided cards featuring key events, reforms, and historical
            milestones, players engage with the long history of relations
            between Georgia and Europe.

            The project was delivered under emergency conditions, requiring a
            full-service development within one week. Our team developed the
            idea, design, structure, format and advertising materials from the
            scratch. Seemingly impossible project became an unforgettable feat
            of our joint group-work and dedicated approach, successfully
            finishing the project within the deadline.
