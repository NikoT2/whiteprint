    title: "The Ur-Bridge",
    image: "/images/02 JPG Full.jpeg",
    description:
      "The uniqueness of this work lies in how it redefines the relationship between center and periphery. The literal bridge also becomes a metaphorical one — it enables us to inhabit the space in the most visceral way. What I find compelling is how the bridge lets us feel everything else instead of demanding our attention. It quietly activates the inner ecology of this world, allowing the surroundings to breathe through it",

    title: "De Haar Castle",
    image: "/images/01 JPG Full.jpeg",
    description:
      "From this vantage point, De Haar Castle seems to belong naturally to its surroundings. The clearing reveals the castle not as something imposed on the landscape, but as part of it—almost as if it were a logical extension or an outgrowth of the terrain itself. This perspective challenges the common idea that human handiwork is always in opposition to, or dominating over, nature.",

    title: "Profound Patience",
    image: "/images/03 JPG Full.jpeg",
    description:
      "What this artwork suggests is that magic is not merely an accident—a fortunate instant when one happens to capture something rare. Rather, it reveals that when the mind settles into profound calmness, nature discloses itself in subtle and bewitching forms. I would call this an art of patience, where instead of actively chasing the moment, one simply allows it to happen.",
